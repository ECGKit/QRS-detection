# Q, R, and S Detection from ECG
This is a general prototype of Q, R, S detection on ECG including Q and S point label inspired by "Pan-Tompkins" algorithms.

### Dependencies
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### run example
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/KChen89/QRS-detection.git
~$ cd /your folder
~$ python3 QRS.py ECG_sample.dat
```

Testing data needs to be in the **data** folder in single column format.
