# Q, R, and S Detection from ECG
This is a variant implementation of [1] including Q and S point label. 

![Q,R,S, label in ECG.](screenshots/sample.png)

### run example
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/KChen89/QRS-detection.git
~$ cd /your folder
~$ python3 QRS.py ECG_sample.dat
```

Testing data needs to be in the **data** folder in single column format. Please cite [1][2][3] if use.
